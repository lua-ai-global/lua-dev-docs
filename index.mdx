title: "Lua - Build AI Agents That Do Anything"
description: "Create AI agents with custom capabilities by connecting to any API using TypeScript"
---

## Get started in 5 minutes

**Lua is the Agent OS that abstracts the technical complexities and helps engineers focus on business logic.** Ship your first agent without touching infraâ€”just write TypeScript tools and go live.

---

### 1. Install the CLI

<CodeGroup>

```bash npm
npm install -g lua-cli
```

```bash yarn
yarn global add lua-cli
```

```bash pnpm
pnpm add -g lua-cli
```

</CodeGroup>

*Node 16+ recommended.* [Installation Guide â†’](/getting-started/installation)

---

### 2. Authenticate (one-time)

```bash
lua auth configure
```

Enter your email, confirm the 6-digit code, and we'll securely store your API key for you. [Auth Guide â†’](/cli/authentication)

---

### 3. Create your project

```bash
mkdir my-agent && cd my-agent
lua init
```

Pick **Create new agent** and follow the prompts. The template includes ready-to-run examples. [Quick Start Guide â†’](/getting-started/quick-start)

---

### 4. Run it locally

```bash
lua test
```

Select a tool and try different inputs. The starter includes **30+ working tools** (e.g., a no-API-key weather tool) so you can see the pattern right away. [Template Overview â†’](/template/overview)

---

### 5. Deploy & chat

```bash
lua push && lua deploy   # ship to production
lua chat                 # chat in sandbox or production
```

Use `lua chat` for an interactive CLI session; sandbox chat auto-bundles your local skills after a quick push. [Chat Command â†’](/cli/chat-command)

## Add your first business-logic tool

Here's all the code you need to add a custom capability:

<CodeGroup>

```typescript src/tools/SayHello.ts
import { LuaTool } from 'lua-cli';
import { z } from 'zod';

export class SayHello implements LuaTool {
  name = 'say_hello';
  description = 'Greets a user by name';
  inputSchema = z.object({ name: z.string() });
  
  async execute(input: { name: string }) {
    return { message: `Hello, ${input.name}!` };
  }
}
```

```typescript src/index.ts
import { LuaAgent, LuaSkill } from 'lua-cli';
import { SayHello } from './tools/SayHello';

const helloSkill = new LuaSkill({
  name: 'hello-skill',
  description: 'Greeting capabilities',
  context: 'Use say_hello to greet users by name',
  tools: [new SayHello()]
});

export const agent = new LuaAgent({
  name: 'hello-agent',
  persona: 'You are a friendly assistant. Be warm and concise.',
  welcomeMessage: 'Hi! How can I help you today?',
  skills: [helloSkill]
});
```

</CodeGroup>

**That's it.** This mirrors the agent/skill/tool patternâ€”focus purely on your domain logic. [Build Your First Skill â†’](/getting-started/first-skill)

---

## Add chat to your website (1 line)

```html
<script src="https://lua-ai-global.github.io/lua-pop/lua-pop.umd.js"></script>
<script>
  window.LuaPop.init({ 
    agentId: "your-agent-id", 
    position: "bottom-right"
  });
</script>
```

Drop this on any page to embed AI chat instantly. [LuaPop Widget Guide â†’](/chat-widget/quick-start)

## Focus on Business Logic, Not Infrastructure

Lua abstracts away all the complexity so you can ship faster:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Infrastructure" icon="server">
    **We handle:** Hosting, auto-scaling, load balancing, CDN delivery, uptime monitoring
    
    **You focus on:** Writing functions that solve business problems
  </Card>
  <Card title="LLM Complexity & Cost" icon="brain">
    **We handle:** Model selection, prompt engineering, token optimization, API rate limits, cost management
    
    **You focus on:** What your agent should do, not how AI models work
  </Card>
  <Card title="Multi-Channel Orchestration" icon="layer-group">
    **We handle:** Web, mobile, WhatsApp, Slack, Instagram, Facebook Messengerâ€”all channels managed
    
    **You focus on:** Building capabilities once, deploy everywhere instantly
  </Card>
  <Card title="Agent Orchestration" icon="gears">
    **We handle:** Tool calling logic, context management, conversation flow, error recovery, retries
    
    **You focus on:** Simple functions that fetch and return data
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<Note>
**Build in hours, not months.** Skip the months of infrastructure work, LLM integration complexity, and channel management. Just write TypeScript functions that connect to your APIs, and we handle everything else.
</Note>

## Integrate With ANY API

Connect to your existing systems or any third-party service:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Your APIs">
    **100% Custom Integration**
    
    ```typescript
    class YourCustomTool implements LuaTool {
      async execute(input) {
        const response = await fetch('https://your-backend.com/api/endpoint', {
          headers: { 'X-API-Key': env('YOUR_API_KEY') }
        });
        return processYourData(await response.json());
      }
    }
    ```
    
    Perfect for existing infrastructure, custom business requirements, or any industry
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Platform APIs">
    **Optional Built-In Helpers**
    
    ```typescript
    import { Products, Baskets, Data } from 'lua-cli';
    
    const products = await Products.search('laptop');
    const basket = await Baskets.create({ currency: 'USD' });
    const results = await Data.search('docs', 'query');
    ```
    
    Great for rapid prototyping, e-commerce MVPs, or when you don't have a backend yet
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="External Services">
    **Third-Party Integrations**
    
    ```typescript
    // Stripe, SendGrid, Shopify, Zendesk, etc.
    const stripe = await fetch('https://api.stripe.com/v1/charges', {
      headers: { 'Authorization': `Bearer ${env('STRIPE_KEY')}` }
    });
    ```
    
    Connect to any REST/GraphQL APIâ€”Stripe, SendGrid, weather, maps, anything
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

<Note>
**Platform APIs are completely optional!** They're convenience helpers for common e-commerce and data tasks. You can build agents that integrate with ANY system using standard HTTP/REST/GraphQL calls.
</Note>
