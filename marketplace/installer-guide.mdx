## Finding Skills

The marketplace offers a wide range of skills to enhance your agent.

1. **Run the installer menu**:
   ```bash
   lua marketplace install
   ```
2. Select **"Browse & Search for skills"**.
3. You can browse the full list or enter a search term.
   - Search matches against skill names, descriptions, and tags.
4. Select a skill to view details, including:
   - Description and category
   - Verified status
   - Author
   - Available versions and tools
   - Required environment variables

### Installing a Skill

Once you've found a skill:

1. Select **"Install"** (if viewing details) or choose **"Install a skill from the Marketplace"** from the main menu.
2. **Version Selection**:
   - The CLI will show available versions.
   - By default, the latest stable version is recommended.
3. **Configuration**:
   - If the skill requires environment variables (e.g., API keys), you will be prompted to enter them.
   - These values are securely stored in your agent's environment variables.
4. **Confirmation**: Review the installation details and confirm.

The skill is now installed on your agent and ready to use!

### Managing Installed Skills

You can manage your installed skills directly from the CLI:

- **List Installed**: See all marketplace skills currently on your agent.
- **Update**: Upgrade a skill to a newer version.
  - The CLI checks for updates and lets you choose a new version.
  - You can also update environment variable configuration without changing versions.
- **Uninstall**: Remove a skill and its configuration from your agent.

<Note>
  **Safety Check**: The CLI prevents you from installing a skill that is already present on your agent to avoid conflicts. Use the **Update** command to modify existing installations.
