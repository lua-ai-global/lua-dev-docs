## Becoming a Creator

As a creator, you can share your agent skills with the entire Lua community. Whether it's a specialized tool, a complex integration, or a utility job, the marketplace handles versioning, distribution, and discovery.

### Listing a Skill

To list a skill, it must be defined in your project and **pushed to the server**. The marketplace verifies the skill against your agent's active skills on the server.

1. **Run the creator menu**:
   ```bash
   lua marketplace create
   ```
2. Select **"List a new skill on the Marketplace"**.
3. Choose the skill you want to publish (fetched from your agent on the server).
4. **Metadata**: Follow the prompts to configure your skill's listing details.
   - **Display Name**: Enter a user-friendly name (e.g., "Hotel Concierge").
   - *Note: Additional metadata fields may be requested in future updates.*
5. The skill is now listed!

### Publishing Versions

Listing a skill creates the entry, but users can't install it until you publish a **version**.

1. Select **"Publish a new version of a skill"**.
2. Choose your listed skill.
3. Select the version to publish (e.g., `1.0.0`).
   - The CLI detects versions that have been compiled and pushed to the server.
4. **Configuration**:
   - **Environment Variables**: Define any variables your skill needs (e.g., `HOTEL_API_KEY`).
   - **Changelog**: Optionally add a note about what's new in this version.
   - Complete any other required configuration steps.

<Note>
  **Semantic Versioning**: The marketplace uses SemVer. Always ensure your version numbers (e.g., `1.0.1`, `2.0.0`) reflect the nature of your changes.
</Note>

### Managing Listings

You can manage your existing skills through the same menu:

- **Update Metadata**: Change the display name of your skill.
- **Unlist Skill**: Remove the skill from the marketplace (hides it from search).
- **Unpublish Version**: Remove a specific version if it has issues.
- **View Listed Skills**: See a summary of your published skills, install counts, and latest versions.

### Best Practices

- **Clear Documentation**: Use descriptive names and helpful descriptions for your environment variables.
- **SemVer**: Increment patch versions for bug fixes, minor for features, and major for breaking changes.
- **Vector Search**: Your skill's name and description are indexed. Make them relevant to what users might search for (e.g., "moderation", "payment", "weather").
