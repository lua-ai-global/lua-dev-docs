    ```
    Our business hours are 9-5 PM.
    (Actually changed to 8-6 PM months ago)
    
    We ship within 5-7 days.
    (Actually now 2-3 days)
    ```
    
    **Why it fails:**
    - Gives wrong information
    - Undermines trust
    - Creates customer frustration
    
    **Fix:** Regular persona reviews and updates
