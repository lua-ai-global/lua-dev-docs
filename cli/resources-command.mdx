## Overview

The `lua resources` command manages your agent's knowledge base - documents and information that your agent can reference during conversations.

```bash
lua resources
```

### Non-Interactive Mode

```bash
# List all resources
lua resources list

# View a specific resource
lua resources view --resource-name "FAQ Document"

# Delete a resource
lua resources delete --resource-name "Old Document"
```

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `--resource-name <name>` | Resource name (for view/delete) |

| Action | Description | Required Options |
|--------|-------------|------------------|
| `list` | List all resources | None |
| `view` | View resource content | `--resource-name` |
| `delete` | Delete a resource | `--resource-name` |

<Note>
**Note:** Creating and updating resources requires interactive mode due to the editor integration for writing long-form content.

- FAQs and common questions
- Return/refund policies
- Shipping information
- Troubleshooting guides
- Company history and values
- Pricing information

- Retrieves accurate information

```
User: "What's your return policy?"

Agent: [Searches resources]
       [Finds "Return Policy"]
       [Reads content]
       
Response: "We accept returns within 45 days of purchase.
The item must be unused in original packaging..."
```

# In persona
$ lua persona → Edit

"You are a customer service agent.

When answering questions, always check your resources for:
