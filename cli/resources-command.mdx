- Troubleshooting guides
- Company history and values
- Pricing information

## Integration with Agent

### How Agents Use Resources

**Automatically:**
- Searches when relevant
- Retrieves accurate information
- Provides consistent answers
- References specific resources

**Example conversation:**
```
User: "What's your return policy?"

Agent: [Searches resources]
       [Finds "Return Policy"]
       [Reads content]
       
Response: "We accept returns within 45 days of purchase.
The item must be unused in original packaging..."
```

```bash
# In persona
$ lua persona → Edit

"You are a customer service agent.

When answering questions, always check your resources for:
- Product details → Product Catalog
- Return questions → Return Policy
- Shipping questions → Shipping Information

```
