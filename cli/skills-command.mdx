## Overview

The `lua skills` command provides a dedicated interface for viewing local skills and managing production skill deployments.

```bash
lua skills               # Interactive: choose environment
lua skills sandbox       # Direct: view local skills
lua skills staging       # Direct: alias for sandbox
lua skills production    # Direct: manage production skills
```

<Note>
**New in v2.6.0:** Dedicated skills management command with environment-specific features!
</Note>

### Non-Interactive Mode

```bash
# View all production skills
lua skills view

# View skill versions
lua skills versions --skill-name mySkill

# Deploy specific version
lua skills deploy --skill-name mySkill --skill-version 1.0.3

# Deploy latest version
lua skills deploy --skill-name mySkill --skill-version latest
```

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `--skill-name <name>` | Skill name (for versions/deploy) |
| `--skill-version <ver>` | Version or 'latest' (for deploy) |

| Action | Description | Required Options |

### Use Cases

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Check Active Versions">
    Verify what's running in production:
    ```bash
    lua skills production
    # See active versions at a glance
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Rollback">
    Roll back to a previous version:
    ```bash
    lua skills production
    # Select skill → View history → Deploy older version
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Deploy Specific Version">

    ```bash
    lua skills production
    # View when each version was created
    ```
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Safety Features

<Warning>
**Production deployments require two confirmations:**
1. Select version to deploy
2. Confirm deployment (defaults to "No")

This prevents accidental deployments and ensures you're deploying the right version.
</Warning>

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Check Before Deploying">

    ```bash
    lua skills production
    # Review active versions
    lua deploy
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Keep Version History">

    lua skills production
    # View history → Shows all available versions
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Test in Sandbox First">
    Always test locally before pushing:

    lua test           # Test tools
    lua chat           # Test conversationally
    lua push skill     # Then push
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Document Version Changes">
    Use semantic versioning and keep notes:
    ```yaml
    # In lua.skill.yaml
    skills:
