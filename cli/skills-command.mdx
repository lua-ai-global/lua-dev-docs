### Safety Features

<Warning>
**Production deployments require two confirmations:**
1. Select version to deploy
2. Confirm deployment (defaults to "No")

This prevents accidental deployments and ensures you're deploying the right version.

    lua skills production
    # Review active versions
    lua deploy
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Keep Version History">

    lua push skill     # Then push
    ```
