## Why This Command?

### Before lua production

```bash
# Fragmented workflow
$ lua persona    # Check persona
$ lua deploy     # Wait, this deploys, not views!
$ lua env        # Check environment variables
# Multiple steps, confusing
```

### After lua production

```bash
# Unified workflow
$ lua production
→ Persona: ✓ Check current
→ Skills: ✓ See all deployed
→ Env: ✓ Manage variables
# Everything in one place!
```
