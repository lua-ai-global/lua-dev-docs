    Explain what the feature is for:
    
    ```
    ✅ Good:
    "Use this feature to search our internal knowledge base
    for product documentation, FAQs, and policies."
    
    ❌ Bad:
    "Search stuff."
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="When to Use">
    Specify appropriate situations:
    
    ```
    ✅ Good:
    "Create a support ticket when:
    - Customer reports a bug
    - Issue requires technical team review
    - Problem cannot be solved immediately
    
    Do NOT create tickets for:
    - Simple questions answered in FAQ
    - Billing issues (escalate to billing team)
    - General information requests"
    
    ❌ Bad:
    "Create tickets for problems."
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Guidelines and Rules">
    Set boundaries and expectations:
    
    ```
    ✅ Good:
    "When using web search:
    1. Use for current events and real-time data
    2. Verify information with multiple sources
    3. Cite sources in your response
    4. If search fails, inform user honestly
    5. Don't rely on search for company-specific info"
    
    ❌ Bad:
    "Search the web when needed."
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Examples">
    Provide concrete examples:
    
    ```
    ✅ Good:
    "Example inquiry form fields:
    - Name (required)
    - Email (required)
    - Company name
    - Company size (1-10, 11-50, 51-200, 201+)
    - Budget range
    - Timeline for decision
    - Additional notes"
    
    ❌ Bad:
    "Collect customer information."
    ```
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Context Templates

#### Support Tickets Template

```markdown
Create support tickets for customer issues that require tracking.

When to create tickets:
- Technical problems or bugs
- Feature requests
- Issues requiring follow-up
- Problems needing escalation

Ticket information to collect:
- Clear description of the issue
- Steps to reproduce (for bugs)
- Customer impact level (low/medium/high)

Do NOT create tickets for:

Search the internal knowledge base for information.

Categories available:

1. Try specific queries first
2. Use category filters when possible
3. Always cite the document source
4. If not found, try broader terms

When information is not found:
- Say so clearly and honestly
- Offer to escalate if needed
- Suggest alternative resources
```

#### Web Search Template

```markdown
Use web search for real-time, current information.

Appropriate for:
- Current events and news
- Real-time data (stock prices, weather)
- Recent industry updates
- Public information not in knowledge base

Not appropriate for:
- Company-specific information (use RAG)
- Customer data or internal systems
- Proprietary information
- Historical company information

Always:
- Verify information quality
- Cite sources with URLs
- Cross-reference when possible
- Note the date of information
```

Create inquiry forms to collect lead information.

Standard fields to include:
- Full name (required)
