### Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Completions not working">
    **Problem**: Tab completion doesn't work after installation
    
    **Solutions:**
    1. Restart your terminal or reload shell config:
       ```bash
       # Bash
       source ~/.bashrc
       
       # Zsh
       source ~/.zshrc
       
       # Fish (automatic)
       ```
    
    2. Verify script was added correctly:
       ```bash
       # Check if completion is in config
       tail ~/.bashrc    # or ~/.zshrc
       ```
    
    3. Try explicit installation:
       ```bash
       eval "$(lua completion bash)"  # Or zsh
       ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Completions incomplete">
    **Problem**: Some commands complete, others don't
    
    **Solutions:**
    1. Regenerate completion script:
       ```bash
       lua completion bash > /tmp/lua_completions
       cat /tmp/lua_completions >> ~/.bashrc
       source ~/.bashrc
       ```
    
    2. Check Lua CLI version:
       ```bash
       lua --version
       # Should be v2.6.0 or higher
       ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Fish completions not loading">
    **Problem**: Completions don't work in Fish shell
    
    **Solutions:**
    1. Verify file location:
       ```bash
       ls ~/.config/fish/completions/lua.fish
       ```
    
    2. Regenerate if missing:
       ```bash
       mkdir -p ~/.config/fish/completions
       lua completion fish > ~/.config/fish/completions/lua.fish
       ```
    
    3. Restart Fish shell
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Conflict with existing completions">
    **Problem**: Completions conflict with other tools
    
    **Solution:**
    Remove old completion and reinstall:

    vim ~/.bashrc  # or ~/.zshrc
    # Delete old lua completion lines
