description: "Detect and resolve drift between server state and local code"

## Overview

The `lua sync` command detects differences (drift) between your server-deployed configuration and local code, helping you keep them in sync.

```bash
lua sync
```

<Note>
  The sync command helps prevent accidental overwrites when someone updates the agent from the admin dashboard while you're working locally.
</Note>

## What Gets Synced

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Name** | Agent name defined in `LuaAgent({ name: "..." })` |
| **Persona** | Agent persona defined in `LuaAgent({ persona: "..." })` |

## How It Works

1. **Fetches server state** - Gets the latest published persona and agent name from the server
2. **Compares with local** - Checks your `src/index.ts` LuaAgent configuration
3. **Shows colored diff** - Displays exactly what changed
4. **Prompts for action** - Update local from server or keep local

## Usage

### Interactive Sync

```bash
lua sync
```

If drift is detected, you'll see a colored diff:

```
============================================================
PERSONA DIFF
- Server (deployed)  + Local (code)
============================================================

  <persona>
    <identity>
-     Old Agent Name
+     New Agent Name
    </identity>
  ... (unchanged lines) ...

============================================================

? What would you like to do with persona?
❯ 📥 Update local from server
  ⏭️  Skip (keep local)
```

**Diff colors:**
- 🔴 **Red** (`-`) = Line exists on server but not in local code
- 🟢 **Green** (`+`) = Line exists in local code but not on server
- Gray = Unchanged lines (abbreviated if many)

### During Compile

Sync is automatically checked during `lua compile`:

```bash
lua compile           # Checks for drift, prompts if found
lua compile --no-sync # Skip sync check
lua compile --force-sync # Auto-update from server without prompting
```

## Options

### Sync Command Options

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `--check` | Check for drift only, exit code 1 if drift found (CI validation) |
| `--accept` | Auto-accept server state without prompting |

### Compile Integration

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `--no-sync` | Skip drift detection during compile |
| `--force-sync` | Automatically update local from server if drift detected |

### Non-Interactive Mode

```bash
# Check for drift only (returns exit code 1 if drift detected)
lua sync --check

# Auto-sync from server without prompting
lua sync --accept
```

### Examples

```bash
# Check for drift interactively
lua sync

# Check only, fail if drift (for CI)
lua sync --check

# Auto-accept server state
lua sync --accept

# Compile without sync check (useful for CI/CD)
lua compile --no-sync

# Auto-sync before compile (useful for pulling latest)
lua compile --force-sync
```

### CI/CD Workflow Example

```yaml
# GitHub Actions example
name: Deploy Agent

on:
  push:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      
      - name: Check for drift
        run: lua sync --check
      
      - name: Compile
        run: lua compile --no-sync
      
      - name: Push version
        run: lua push skill --name mySkill --version ${{ github.sha }} --force
      
      - name: Deploy to production
        run: lua deploy --skill-name mySkill --skill-version latest --force
```

## Common Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Someone Updated Persona in Dashboard

You're developing locally, and a colleague updated the persona from the admin dashboard.

```bash
$ lua sync
⚠️  Drift detected!

============================================================
PERSONA DIFF
- Server (deployed)  + Local (code)
============================================================

  <persona>
-   Updated persona from dashboard
+   Your local persona version
  </persona>

? What would you like to do with persona?
❯ 📥 Update local from server   # Get their changes
  ⏭️  Skip (keep local)         # Keep yours (will overwrite on next push)
```

### Scenario 2: Forgot to Push Changes

You made changes locally but forgot to push before reverting your code.

```bash
$ lua sync
✅ No drift detected. Local code is in sync with server.
```

### Scenario 3: CI/CD Pipeline

In your deployment pipeline, you might want to ensure no drift:

```bash
# Will exit with error if drift exists (user must resolve manually)
lua compile

# Or skip sync in CI (push will overwrite server)
lua compile --no-sync
```

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Run sync before starting work">
    Always run `lua sync` when starting a new session to catch any changes made by teammates or from the dashboard.
    
    ```bash
    cd my-agent
    lua sync           # Check for drift
    lua compile        # Start development
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Use --force-sync for fresh pulls">
    When you want to ensure you have the latest server state:
    
    ```bash
    lua compile --force-sync
    ```
    
    This automatically updates your local code without prompting.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Use --no-sync in CI/CD">
    In automated pipelines where you want your code to be the source of truth:
    
    ```bash
    lua compile --no-sync && lua push skill
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Commit after syncing">
    After syncing from server, commit the changes to preserve them:
    
    ```bash
    lua sync
    # Select "Update local from server"
    git add src/index.ts
    git commit -m "sync: update persona from server"
    ```
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## How Server Versions Work

The sync command compares against the **latest published** persona version, not the currently active one:

| Version Type | Description | Used for Sync? |
|--------------|-------------|----------------|
| **Draft** | Created but not deployed | ❌ No |
| **Published** | Has been deployed at least once | ✅ Yes (latest) |
| **Current** | Currently active in production | ❌ No |

This means if you roll back to an older version in production, sync will still compare against the most recent push (not the rollback).

## Error Handling

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="No drift detected">
    ```
    ✅ No drift detected. Local code is in sync with server.
    ```
    
    Your local code matches the server. No action needed.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Network error">
    If the server is unreachable, sync will silently continue to avoid blocking your workflow.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="No persona on server">
    If no persona has been pushed to the server yet, sync will report no drift.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
