## v3.5.0

**Released:** February 20, 2026

### ✨ New Features

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="User Lookup by Email or Phone">
    The `User.get()` method now supports looking up users by email address or phone number, in addition to userId.

    ```typescript
    import { User } from 'lua-cli';

    // Look up by email
    const user = await User.get({ email: 'customer@example.com' });

    // Look up by phone (both formats work)
    const user = await User.get({ phone: '+1234567890' });

    // Handle not found (returns null, doesn't throw)
    if (!user) {
      return { error: 'User not found' };
    }
    ```

    Useful for webhooks receiving contact info from external systems.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Integrations Command">
    Connect your agent to 250+ third-party services via [Unified.to](https://unified.to). When you connect an account, an MCP server is automatically created to expose tools to your agent.

    ```bash
    lua integrations              # Interactive mode
    lua integrations connect      # Connect (OAuth or API token)
    lua integrations list         # List connected accounts
    lua integrations webhooks     # Manage webhook triggers
    lua integrations mcp          # Manage MCP servers
    ```

    **Key Features:**
    - OAuth and API token authentication
    - Automatic MCP server creation and activation per connection
    - Event-driven webhook triggers that wake up your agent
    - Server-side finalization for reliable connection setup

    See the [Integrations Command](/cli/integrations-command) documentation.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Webhook Triggers for Integrations">
    Event-driven triggers that wake up your agent when events occur in connected services.

    ```bash
    # Connect with triggers (all selected by default in interactive mode)
    lua integrations connect --integration linear --auth-method oauth --scopes all \
      --triggers task_task.created,task_task.updated

    # Use custom webhook URL instead of agent trigger
    lua integrations connect --integration linear --auth-method oauth --scopes all \
      --triggers task_task.created --custom-webhook --hook-url https://my-server.com/webhook
    ```

    - Triggers pre-selected by default in interactive mode
    - Choose between "Agent wake-up" mode or custom webhook URLs
    - Friendly labels for OAuth scopes and webhook events
    - JSON output: `lua integrations webhooks list --json`
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Project Backup & Restore">
    Back up your project source files to cloud storage and restore them on any machine.

    ```bash
    # Backup project sources
    lua push backup

    # Restore on new machine
    lua init --agent-id abc123 --restore-sources
    ```

    **Key Features:**
    - Content-addressed storage with automatic deduplication
    - S3 direct upload — no file size limits
    - Efficient incremental backups (only changed files uploaded)
    - Full project recovery on new machines

    See the [Skill Management](/cli/skill-management#lua-push-backup) documentation.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="CI/CD Mode (--ci flag)">
    New global `--ci` flag makes the CLI fail loudly on missing required arguments instead of silently hanging in non-TTY environments.

    ```bash
    # In CI/CD pipelines
    lua --ci push skill --name mySkill --set-version ${{ github.sha }} --force

    # In local development (interactive prompts work normally)
    lua push skill
    ```

    See the [Non-Interactive Mode](/cli/non-interactive-mode#cicd-mode-ci-flag) documentation.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Self-Update Command">
    New `lua update` command for self-updating from npm, plus a background outdated version warning on every command.

    ```bash
    lua update   # Force-fetch latest version and install
    ```

    - Background version check with 24h file cache (zero latency impact)
    - Alpha users stay on alpha channel, stable users stay on latest
    - Boxed warning to stderr when outdated
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Agents Discovery Command">
    New `lua agents` command lists all organizations and agents you have access to.

    ```bash
    lua agents            # Formatted output
    lua agents --json     # JSON output for scripting
    ```

    See the [Utility Commands](/cli/utility-commands#lua-agents) documentation.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Variable References in Primitive Config">
    You can now define primitive properties using variables and imports — not just inline literals.

    ```typescript
    const MY_SCHEDULE = { type: 'cron', expression: '0 9 * * *' };
    const MY_TOOLS = [calculatorTool, weatherTool];
    import { RETRY_CONFIG } from './config';

    export const myJob = defineJob({
      schedule: MY_SCHEDULE,        // ✅ variable reference
      retry: RETRY_CONFIG,          // ✅ imported constant
      execute: async () => { ... }
    });
    ```

    **Supported for:** job schedule/retry, skill tools arrays, MCP server resolver functions, and all agent config arrays.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Complete Push All — Persona & Backup Included">
    `lua push all` now pushes everything including persona and backup:

    ```bash
    lua push all --force                # All primitives + persona + backup
    lua push all --force --auto-deploy  # Also deploys persona to production
    ```

    Persona and backup failures are non-fatal — the rest of the push completes normally.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Auto-Add dist-v2/ to .gitignore">
    The CLI now automatically adds `dist-v2/` to your `.gitignore`:
    - **New projects**: Included in `lua init` template
    - **Existing projects**: Added after first successful compilation
    - Idempotent and safe to run multiple times
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="MCP and Mastra Log Types">
    ```bash
    lua logs --type mcp      # View MCP tool execution logs
    lua logs --type mastra   # View Mastra AI runtime logs
    lua logs --user-id user_123456  # Filter by user ID
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Non-Interactive Configure Command">
    ```bash
    lua configure --api-key YOUR_API_KEY              # Direct setup
    lua configure --email user@example.com            # Request OTP
    lua configure --email user@example.com --otp 123  # Verify OTP
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Non-Interactive Sandbox View Commands">
    ```bash
    lua persona sandbox view    # Print persona and exit
    lua skills sandbox view     # List local skills and exit
    ```
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### 🔧 Breaking Changes

<Warning>
These changes may affect existing scripts and workflows. Please update accordingly.
</Warning>

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Push Flag: --version renamed to --set-version">
    ```bash
    # Old (no longer works)
    lua push skill --name mySkill --version 1.0.5

    # New (correct)
    lua push skill --name mySkill --set-version 1.0.5
    ```

    **Reason:** Avoids confusion with the global `--version` flag that shows CLI version.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Compile Sync: --no-sync changed to --sync (opt-in)">
    ```bash
    # Old behavior (sync ran by default)
    lua compile             # Checked for drift

    # New behavior (sync is opt-in)
    lua compile             # No drift check (fast)
    lua compile --sync      # Enable drift check
    ```

    **New flag:** `--verbose` for detailed compilation output.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### 🚀 Improvements

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Version Conflict Avoidance in Push">
    `lua push --force` now automatically checks the server for the highest existing version.

    **Benefit:** Prevents "Version already exists" errors during automated deployments.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Sync Compiles Before Checking Drift">
    `lua sync` now runs compilation first for more accurate drift detection.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Chat Preprocessor Block Response">
    Chat now displays preprocessor block response text instead of showing empty responses.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Consistent Error Messages">
    All errors now go through standardized formatting for clearer, more actionable messages.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### ⚡ Performance

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Parallel Server Sync During Compilation">
    - **Before**: 6 sequential HTTP calls (~3-6s)
    - **After**: All fetched in parallel (~1s)
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Batch Version Checks in Push All">
    One HTTP call per primitive type instead of one per entity.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Lazy Authentication">
    No upfront validation call. The first API call validates the key.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- **Job Creation**: Fixed `__exports` naming collision when primitives called `Jobs.create()` at runtime
- **Backup Size Limit**: S3 presigned uploads fix "request entity too large" for large projects
- **MCP Server Duplicates**: Intelligent URL merging handles concurrent MCP creation flows
- **Email Channels**: Aligned with updated API schema (mode selection, displayName, response types)
- **Agent Config Arrays**: Defining `jobs: MY_JOBS` via variables no longer silently empties the agent
- **Webhook headerSchema**: Header validation schemas now correctly pushed to server
- **Tool Conditions**: Tools without `condition()` no longer fail at runtime
- **MCP Server Push**: Fixed detection, manifest metadata, and push pipeline (3 bugs)
- **Auth Errors**: `AuthenticationError` properly propagated; 403 Forbidden handling added
- **Compile Sync**: Handlers no longer overwrite each other's IDs
- **Marketplace**: Only shows skills with published and approved versions
- **Test Command**: Fixed preprocessor test handling for object format

### 📝 Interface Updates

- Added `UserLookupOptions` for email/phone lookup
- Added `EmailChannelMode`, `CreateGeneratedEmailChannelResponse`, `CreateExistingEmailChannelResponse`
- Added `MCPServerSource` enum for tracking MCP server origin
- Updated `User.get()` return type to `UserDataInstance | null`
- Added `'mcp'` and `'mastra'` to log type enums

## v3.4.0

**Released:** January 22, 2026

### ✨ New Features

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Non-Destructive Compile Sync">
    The `lua compile` command now uses a safer, non-destructive sync pattern. Instead of automatically deleting primitives on the server that aren't in your local code, it now:
    
    - **Warns** about orphaned primitives (skills, webhooks, jobs, MCP servers)
    - **Suggests** using explicit delete commands
    - **Filters** warnings to CLI-sourced skills only (ignores marketplace and manual skills)
    
    This prevents accidental data loss and gives you full control over what gets removed.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="New Delete Commands">
    Explicit delete commands for managing primitives no longer in your local code:
    
    ```bash
    # Delete a skill from the server
    lua skills delete --skill-name my-old-skill
    
    # Delete a webhook
    lua webhooks delete --webhook-name old-webhook
    
    # Delete a job
    lua jobs delete --job-name deprecated-job
    ```
    
    **Features:**
    - Server lookup for orphaned items not in local YAML
    - Interactive mode with confirmation prompts
    - `--force` flag for non-interactive deletion
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Streamable HTTP MCP Transport">
    Added support for the modern Streamable HTTP transport (MCP spec 2025-03-26):
    
    ```typescript
    const server = new LuaMCPServer({
      name: 'my-api',
      transport: 'streamable-http',  // New transport type
      url: 'https://mcp.example.com/mcp',
      headers: () => ({
        'Authorization': `Bearer ${env("API_KEY")}`
      })
    });
    ```
    
    **Supported transports:**
    - `'streamable-http'` - Modern MCP standard (recommended)
    - `'sse'` - Legacy Server-Sent Events transport
    
    <Warning>
    **stdio transport removed:** Local MCP servers using `stdio` transport are not supported yet. Use remote servers with `streamable-http` or `sse` instead.
    </Warning>
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- **Push**: Fixed crash when pushing primitives without a version field. First push now defaults to version `0.0.1` and shows "(none - first push)" in prompts.

### 📝 Interface Updates

- Added `MCPStreamableHttpServerConfig` interface for streamable-http transport
- Updated `MCPTransport` type to `'sse' | 'streamable-http'`
- Added `SkillSource` type: `'cli' | 'marketplace' | 'manual'`
- Removed `MCPStdioServerConfig` (stdio not supported yet)

## v3.3.0

**Released:** January 20, 2026

### ✨ New Features

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Complete Non-Interactive Mode for All Commands">
    All CLI commands now support full non-interactive operation, enabling seamless automation for AI IDEs, CI/CD pipelines, and shell scripting.
    
    **Design Patterns:**
    - Consistent option naming: `--<entity>-name` and `--<entity>-version`
    - `--force` flag for skipping confirmation prompts
    - `--json` flag for machine-readable output
    - Action arguments for entity management (view, versions, deploy, activate, deactivate)
    
    ```bash
    # Entity management
    lua skills view
    lua skills versions --skill-name mySkill
    lua skills deploy --skill-name mySkill --skill-version 1.0.3
    
    # Init command
    lua init --agent-id abc123
    lua init --agent-name "My Bot" --org-id org1
    
    # Sync command
    lua sync --check    # CI drift detection
    lua sync --accept   # Auto-sync from server
    
    # Test command
    lua test skill --name get_weather --input '{"city": "London"}'
    
    # Logs command
    lua logs --type skill --name mySkill --limit 10 --json
    ```
    
    See the [Non-Interactive Mode Guide](/cli/non-interactive-mode) for complete documentation.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="User Message and Agent Response Log Types">
    The logs command now supports filtering by user messages and agent responses:
    
    ```bash
    lua logs --type user_message --limit 20
    lua logs --type agent_response --limit 20
    ```
    
    - 💬 **User Messages**: View incoming user messages with channel and userId info
    - 🤖 **Agent Responses**: View AI-generated responses with distinct coloring
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Function-Based Environment Resolution for MCP Servers">
    MCP server configurations now support dynamic environment variable resolution using the `env()` API:
    
    ```typescript
    const mcpServer = new LuaMCPServer({
      name: 'mongo-mcp',
      transport: 'stdio',
      command: 'npx',
      args: ['-y', '@mongodb/mcp-server'],
      env: () => ({
        MDB_CONNECTION_STRING: env("MDB_CONNECTION_STRING")
      })
    });
    ```
    
    Also supported for SSE transport with `url` and `headers` resolver functions.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Products.get() Filter Support">
    Added filter support to `Products.get()` with backward compatibility:
    
    ```typescript
    // Backward compatible
    const products = await Products.get(1, 10);

    // New approach with filters
    const products = await Products.get({
      page: 1,
      limit: 10,
      filter: {
        category: 'electronics',
        inStock: true
      }
    });
    ```
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- **Chat**: Allow `lua chat` to work without mandatory skills - agents can now have only webhooks, jobs, or processors
- **Commands**: Normalized action handling for case-insensitive action comparisons

### 🔧 Improvements

- **Chat Command**: Informational message when defaulting to sandbox environment
- **Chat Command**: Improved visual separation between compile logs and chat response
- **Env Command**: Proper error handling for save/delete operations
- **Push Command**: Shared helper functions reduce code duplication

    ```
    
    **Features:**
    - Compare agent name and persona between server state and local code
    - Fetch latest published persona version (excludes drafts and rollbacks)
    - Show colored line-by-line diff for easy comparison
    - Interactive resolution: update local from server or continue with local
    - Integrated into compile flow with `--no-sync` and `--force-sync` flags
  </Accordion>

    ```
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### 💥 Breaking Changes

<Warning>
These changes may require updates to your existing code.
</Warning>

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="JobInstance Restructured">
    `JobInstance` now receives the full `Job` entity with `activeVersion`:
    
    ```typescript
    // Before
    const schedule = job.schedule;
    const id = job.jobId;

    // After
    const schedule = job.activeVersion.schedule;
    const id = job.id;
    await job.trigger(); // New method
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="welcomeMessage Removed from LuaAgent">
    The `welcomeMessage` field has been removed from `LuaAgent` configuration:
    - For voice: use `voiceConfig.welcomeMessage`
    - For chat widgets: use `WebchatChannelConfig.welcomeMessage`
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Webhook Execute Signature Changed">
    Webhook execute functions now receive a single event object:
    
    ```typescript
    // Before
    execute: async (query, headers, body) => {
      // handle webhook
    }

    // After
    execute: async (event) => {
      const { query, headers, body, timestamp } = event;
      // handle webhook
    }
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="PreProcessor Response Redesigned">
    `PreProcessorResult` now uses a discriminated union:
    
    ```typescript
    // Block response
    return { action: 'block', response: 'Blocked' };

    // Proceed response
    return { 
      action: 'proceed', 
      modifiedMessage: [{ type: 'text', text: '...' }] 
    };
    ```
    
    - `modifiedMessage` is now `ChatMessage[]` (array)
    - Added `priority` field for execution order
    - Removed `context` field
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### 🔧 Improvements

- **Data API Type Safety**: `searchText` parameter added to `Data.create()` and `Data.update()`, `data` parameter type changed to `Record<string, any>`
- **PostProcessor Simplified**: Return type now requires `modifiedResponse: string`, removed `async` field
- **Compilation**: Handle `.js` extensions for Node16/NodeNext module resolution
- **Template**: Minimal by default, use `--with-examples` flag for examples
- **Web UI**: React Query, Sonner toasts, improved env panels, docs in toolbar

### 🛠️ Refactoring

- Removed `context` field from webhooks, jobs, and postprocessors
- Removed `version` field from `LuaSkill`, `LuaJob`, and processor configurations
- Improved push command: displays both `webhookId` and `webhook-name` URL formats
- Rewritten `interfaces/jobs.ts` to match `lua-api` DTOs exactly

## v3.0.3

**Released:** October 30, 2025

### 🎯 User API Enhancement

Enhanced `User.get()` method now accepts an optional `userId` parameter:

```typescript
// Get current user (existing behavior)
const userData = await User.get();

// NEW: Get specific user by ID
const specificUser = await User.get('user_123456');
```

**Use Cases:**
- Fetch data for specific users in admin tools
- Access user information in webhooks/jobs
- Multi-user data operations
- User management features

<Note>
This enhancement allows tools, webhooks, and jobs to access any user's data, enabling more sophisticated multi-user scenarios.
</Note>

---

## v3.0.2

**Released:** October 30, 2025

### 🚀 Major Improvements to Compilation System

This release brings comprehensive dependency bundling, debug mode, enhanced validation, and critical bug fixes.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Comprehensive Dependency Bundling">
    All components now properly bundle external dependencies:
    
    - ✅ **LuaWebhooks** bundle dependencies (e.g., Stripe, axios)
    - ✅ **LuaJobs** bundle dependencies
    - ✅ **PreProcessors** bundle dependencies (e.g., lodash)
    - ✅ **PostProcessors** bundle dependencies (e.g., date-fns)
    - ✅ **Nested Jobs** (`Jobs.create()`) independently bundle their own dependencies
    
    **Impact:** All compiled components are now truly portable and self-contained, requiring no dependency installation on deployment targets.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Debug Mode">
    Added `--debug` flag to `lua compile` command:
    
    ```bash
    lua compile --debug
    # or
    LUA_DEBUG=true lua compile
    ```
    
    **Features:**
    - Verbose step-by-step logging
    - Shows detected imports and dependencies
    - Displays bundle sizes (uncompressed and compressed)
    - Preserves temp files for inspection
    - Shows timing information for each component
    - Full error stack traces
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Enhanced Validation">
    - **tsconfig.json validation** - Clear error if missing or invalid
    - **Empty bundle detection** - Warns about suspiciously small bundles (under 100 bytes)
    - **Bundle output validation** - Ensures esbuild creates valid output
    - **Null config handling** - Graceful compilation without lua.skill.yaml
    - **Safe optional chaining** - Fixed crash when agentData is null
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Improved Error Handling">
    Context-aware error messages with actionable hints:
    - Dependency resolution failures → "Run npm install"
    - TypeScript syntax errors → "Check syntax in filename.ts"
    - Missing files → Shows expected path
    - Full stack traces in debug mode
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Import Resolution">
    Enhanced `resolveImportPath()` to support:
    - `.ts`, `.tsx`, `.js`, `.jsx` files
    - Directory imports (`index.ts`, `index.tsx`, `index.js`)
    
    **Critical Fix:** Relative imports now work correctly in Jobs, Webhooks, and Processors:
    
    ```typescript
    // ✅ Now works perfectly
    import { MyService } from "../services/MyService";
    // ✅ Also works
    import { MyService } from "@/services/MyService";
    ```
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- Fixed null reference error when compiling without LuaAgent
- Fixed crash when lua.skill.yaml is missing
- Fixed compilation with empty agent name/persona
- **Critical:** Fixed relative import resolution in all component types

### 🧹 Code Quality

- Removed obsolete `dynamic-job-bundler.ts`
- Extracted common helpers (`extractRelevantImports`, `bundleAndCompressExecuteFunction`)
- Reduced bundling.ts from 1,149 to 1,036 lines (9.8% reduction)
- Added 27 comprehensive tests for bundling, execution, validation, and relative imports

## v3.0.0

**Released:** October 2025

### 🎉 Major Release

Version 3.0.0 focuses on developer experience, deployment automation, and real-time chat capabilities.

### ✨ New Features

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="LuaAgent - Unified Configuration">
    The flagship feature: a single, intuitive way to configure your entire agent.
    
    **Before (v2.x):**
    ```typescript
    export const skill1 = new LuaSkill({ name: 'skill1', tools: [] });
    export const skill2 = new LuaSkill({ name: 'skill2', tools: [] });
    export const webhook1 = new LuaWebhook({ name: 'webhook1', execute: async () => 'ok' });
    ```
    
    **After (v3.0.0):**
    ```typescript
    export const agent = new LuaAgent({
      name: 'my-assistant',
      persona: 'You are a helpful AI assistant...',
      skills: [skill1, skill2],
      webhooks: [webhook1],
      jobs: [job1],
      preProcessors: [processor1],
      postProcessors: [processor2]
    });
    ```
    
    **Benefits:**
    - Single source of truth
    - Clearer organization
    - Automatic YAML synchronization
    - Better IDE support
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Streaming Chat Interface">
    Real-time chat responses with improved UX:
    
    ```bash
    lua chat
    ```
    
    - ✅ Animated typing indicator while waiting
    - ✅ Text streams character-by-character
    - ✅ Sandbox and production environment selection
    - ✅ Uses `/chat/stream` endpoint for real-time updates
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Batch Deployment">
    New command for deploying all components without prompts:
    
    ```bash
    # Push all with auto-versioning
    lua push all --force
    
    # Push and deploy to production
    lua push all --force --auto-deploy
    ```
    
    **What it does:**
    1. Compiles project
    2. Reads all components from `lua.skill.yaml`
    3. Increments patch versions automatically
    4. Pushes all components to server
    5. Deploys to production (if `--auto-deploy`)
    
    **Features:**
    - Auto-bumps patch versions (e.g., `1.0.0` → `1.0.1`)
    - Perfect for CI/CD pipelines
    - Retry mechanism with exponential backoff
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="API Key Fallback">
    Flexible authentication with multiple sources (priority order):
    
    1. **System Keychain** (macOS Keychain, Windows Credential Vault, Linux libsecret)
    2. **Environment Variable** (`LUA_API_KEY`)
    3. **.env File** (`LUA_API_KEY=...`)
    
    **Usage in CI/CD:**
    ```bash
    export LUA_API_KEY=your-key
    lua push all --force --auto-deploy
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Auto-Sync YAML and Code">
    Bidirectional synchronization ensures consistency:
    
    **On `lua init`:**
    - Agent name, persona → YAML + `index.ts` LuaAgent
    
    **On `lua compile`:**
    - LuaAgent persona → YAML
    
    No manual synchronization needed!
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
