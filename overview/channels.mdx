## What are Channels?

**Channels** are the communication platforms where users interact with your AI agent - like WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger, Email, Instagram, Slack, and your website.

  The connection points between your users and your AI agent - where conversations happen
</Card>

## Why Channels Matter

Your agent can respond to users across **all their preferred platforms** - not just one.

## How It Works

```
Customer sends message on WhatsApp
            â†“
   Message forwarded to Lua
            â†“
    Your agent processes it
            â†“
    Agent calls your tools
            â†“
