## How Agents Use Resources

**Automatically during conversations:**

```
User: "What's your return policy?"

Agent: [Searches resources]
       [Finds "Return Policy"]
       [Reads content]
       
Response: "We accept returns within 45 days.
The item must be unused in original packaging..."
```

**The agent decides when to search resources based on:**
- Question keywords
- Context of conversation
- Relevance to query
- Semantic similarity

## Resources vs Tools vs Skills

| Concept | Purpose | Example |
|---------|---------|---------|
| **Tool** | Execute action | `search_products` - Searches catalog |
| **Skill** | Group of tools | E-commerce - Search, cart, checkout |
| **Resource** | Reference info | Product Catalog - What products exist |

**How they work together:**
- **Resources** provide knowledge
- **Tools** take actions
- **Skills** organize tools
- **Persona** defines personality

**Example:**
```
User: "Do you have laptops under $1000?"

1. Persona: "Be friendly and helpful"
2. Resource: Agent checks Product Catalog
3. Tool: Calls search_products tool
4. Skill: E-commerce skill coordinates everything
5. Result: "Yes! We have 3 laptops under $1000..."
```
