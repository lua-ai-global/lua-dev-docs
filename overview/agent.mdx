## What is LuaAgent?

**LuaAgent** is the main configuration object for your entire AI agent. It brings together your persona, skills, webhooks, jobs, and message processors in one unified structure.

<Card title="Think of it as:" icon="robot">
  The "brain" of your AI - where you define who the agent is, what it can do, and how it behaves
</Card>

<Note>
**New in v3.0.0:** LuaAgent replaces the old pattern of exporting individual skills. It's now the recommended way to configure agents.
</Note>

## Anatomy of an Agent

```typescript
import { LuaAgent } from 'lua-cli';

export const agent = new LuaAgent({
  // Required: Who is this agent?
  name: "customer-support-agent",
  
  // Required: What's its personality and behavior?
  persona: `You are a friendly customer support specialist.
  
Your role:
- Help customers with orders and inquiries
- Create support tickets when needed
- Provide accurate information

Communication style:
- Patient and empathetic
- Clear and professional
- Proactive with solutions`,

  // Optional: First message users see
  welcomeMessage: "Hi! I'm here to help. What can I do for you?",
  
  // Optional: Skills with tools
  skills: [customerServiceSkill, productSkill],
  
  // Optional: HTTP endpoints for external events
  webhooks: [stripeWebhook, shopifyWebhook],
  
  // Optional: Scheduled automated tasks
  jobs: [dailyReportJob, cleanupJob],
  
  // Optional: Filter messages before processing
  preProcessors: [profanityFilter, rateLimiter],
  
  // Optional: Format responses before sending
  postProcessors: [addDisclaimer, addBranding]
});
```

## The Three Required Elements

### 1. Name

Unique identifier for your agent:

```typescript
name: "customer-support-agent"
```

**Best Practices:**
- Use lowercase with hyphens
- Be descriptive and specific
- Keep it short (2-4 words)

### 2. Persona

Defines your agent's personality, behavior, and capabilities:

```typescript
persona: `You are Dr. Health, a medical information assistant.

Role: Provide general health information and wellness tips.

Guidelines:
- Always clarify you're not a licensed doctor
- Recommend seeing professionals for serious concerns
- Use clear, non-technical language
- Be empathetic and supportive

Tone: Professional, caring, informative`
```

**Best Practices:**
- Clearly define the role
- List specific capabilities
- Set boundaries and limitations
- Define communication style
- Include do's and don'ts

### 3. Skills

At least one skill with tools:

```typescript
skills: [mySkill]
```

Without skills, the agent has no capabilities!

## Optional Components

### Welcome Message

First message users see:

```typescript
welcomeMessage: "Hi! I'm your shopping assistant. Ready to help you find the perfect product!"
```

### Webhooks

HTTP endpoints for external events:

```typescript
webhooks: [paymentWebhook, orderWebhook]
```

**Use for:** Stripe payments, Shopify orders, GitHub events

### Jobs

Scheduled automated tasks:

```typescript
jobs: [dailyReportJob, weeklyCleanupJob]
```

**Use for:** Daily reports, cleanup tasks, monitoring

### PreProcessors

Filter messages before they reach your agent:

```typescript
preProcessors: [profanityFilter, businessHoursFilter]
```

**Use for:** Spam filtering, routing, validation

### PostProcessors

Format responses after agent generation:

```typescript
postProcessors: [addDisclaimer, addBranding]
```

**Use for:** Disclaimers, branding, translation

## Real-World Example

Complete agent with all features:

```typescript
import { 
  LuaAgent, 
  LuaSkill, 
  LuaWebhook, 
  LuaJob,
  PreProcessor,
  PostProcessor 
} from 'lua-cli';

export const agent = new LuaAgent({
  name: "ecommerce-assistant",
  
  persona: `You are Emma, a helpful e-commerce assistant for Acme Store.
  
Your role:
- Help customers find products

- Answer product questions

Communication style:

Limitations:

- Escalate refunds over $100 to manager`,

  welcomeMessage: "Hi! I'm Emma from Acme Store. I can help you find products, manage your cart, and track orders.",
  
  skills: [
    productSearchSkill,
    cartManagementSkill,
    orderTrackingSkill
  ],
  
  webhooks: [
    stripePaymentWebhook,
    shopifyOrderWebhook
  ],
  
  jobs: [
    dailySalesReport,
    abandonedCartReminder
  ],
  
  preProcessors: [
    profanityFilter,
    rateLimiter
  ],
  
  postProcessors: [
    addLegalDisclaimer,
    addBrandingFooter
  ]
});
```

## How It All Works Together

```
User Message
    ↓
PreProcessors (filter/validate)
    ↓
AI Agent (uses Persona)
    ↓
Calls Tools (from Skills)
    ↓
PostProcessors (format/enhance)
    ↓
Response to User

External Events → Webhooks → Trigger Actions
Scheduled Time → Jobs → Automated Tasks
```
