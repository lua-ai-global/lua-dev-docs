## What is a Skill?

A **skill** is a collection of related tools bundled together. It defines what capabilities your agent has and how to use them.

<Card title="Think of it as:" icon="puzzle-piece">
  A capability module - like "Customer Service" or "Order Management" - that groups related tools together
</Card>

<Note>
**v3.0.0 Update:** Skills are now added to your agent through the `LuaAgent` class. See [Agent Concept](/overview/agent) for the complete configuration pattern.
</Note>

## Anatomy of a Skill

```typescript
const customerServiceSkill = new LuaSkill({
  name: "customer-service",
  description: "Customer support and order management",
  context: `...`,  // ← Critical! Tells agent how to use tools
  tools: [
    new SearchOrdersTool(),
    new CreateTicketTool(),
    new CheckStatusTool()
  ]
});
```

</CardGroup>

## The Context Field: Most Important Part

The **context** field tells the AI agent **how and when** to use the tools in your skill.

<Warning>
**The context field is critical!** Without good context, the AI won't know when to use your tools or how to use them correctly.
</Warning>

### What Good Context Looks Like

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="❌ Bad Context">
    ```typescript
    context: "A skill with tools for stuff"
    ```
    
    **Problems:**
    - Too vague
    - No tool guidance
    - No usage instructions
    - Agent won't know what to do
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="✅ Good Context">
    ```typescript
    context: `
      This skill manages customer orders and support tickets.
      
      Tool Usage:
      - search_orders: Use when customers ask about order status,
        tracking, or "where is my order". Requires order number or email.
      
      - create_ticket: Use when customer has an unresolved issue
        that needs human follow-up. Ask for issue details first.
      
      - check_status: Use to get current status of existing ticket.
        Requires ticket ID from previous create_ticket call.
      
      Guidelines:
      - Always ask for order number before searching
      - Confirm issue details before creating ticket
      - Provide ticket ID after creation
      - Set expectations for response time (24 hours)
      
      Do NOT create tickets for:
      - Simple questions answered by FAQ
      - Order status checks (use search_orders instead)
      - Product questions (use product-skill instead)
    `
    ```
    
    **Why it's good:**
    - Explains when to use each tool
    - Provides usage guidelines
    - Sets expectations
    - Defines boundaries
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Context Field Structure

```typescript
context: `
  [1. What this skill does - one sentence]
  
  Tool Usage:
  - tool_name_1: [When to use] [What it needs] [What it returns]
  - tool_name_2: [When to use] [What it needs] [What it returns]
  
  Guidelines:
  - [Important rule 1]
  - [Important rule 2]
  - [Edge case handling]
  
  [Optional] Do NOT:
  - [Boundary 1]
  - [Boundary 2]
  
  [Optional] When [situation]:
  - [Specific action]
`
```

## Good Skill Examples

### Example 1: E-commerce Skill

```typescript
const ecommerceSkill = new LuaSkill({
  name: "ecommerce-assistant",
  description: "Shopping and checkout assistance",
  context: `
    This skill helps customers shop and complete purchases.
    
    Tool Usage:
    - search_products: When users describe what they want to buy.
      Returns matching products with prices and availability.
    
    - add_to_cart: When customer decides to purchase something.
      Confirm product and quantity before adding.
    
    - checkout: When customer is ready to complete purchase.
      Must have items in cart. Ask for shipping address.
    
    Guidelines:
    - Always confirm product details before adding to cart
    - Show total price before checkout
    - Mention free shipping over $50
    - Ask about gift wrapping for orders > $100
    
    Do NOT:
    - Add items without confirmation
    - Checkout without shipping address
    - Promise delivery dates you can't guarantee
  `,
  tools: [
    new SearchProductsTool(),
    new AddToCartTool(),
    new CheckoutTool()
  ]
});
```

### Example 2: Support Skill

```typescript
const supportSkill = new LuaSkill({
  name: "customer-support",
  description: "Help desk and troubleshooting",
  context: `
    This skill provides technical support and issue resolution.
    
    Tool Usage:
    - search_kb: ALWAYS check knowledge base FIRST before asking
      user for details. Search for relevant articles.
    
    - create_ticket: Create support ticket ONLY if knowledge base
      doesn't solve the issue. Ask for full problem description.
    
    - get_ticket_status: Check status of existing ticket.
      Requires ticket ID from previous conversation.
    
    Workflow:
    1. User describes issue
    2. Search knowledge base (search_kb)
    3. If found: Provide solution from KB
    4. If not found: Create ticket (create_ticket)
    5. Provide ticket ID and set expectations
    
    Guidelines:
    - Search KB before bothering user with questions
    - Ask diagnostic questions if KB search unclear
    - Always provide ticket ID after creation
    - Mention 24-hour response time for tickets
    - Be empathetic with frustrated users
  `,
  tools: [
    new SearchKnowledgeBaseTool(),
    new CreateTicketTool(),
    new GetTicketStatusTool()
  ]
});
```

## Key Principles

### 1. One Skill = One Purpose

<CodeGroup>

```typescript Good: Focused
const orderSkill = new LuaSkill({
  name: "order-management",
  description: "Order processing and tracking",
  tools: [
    new CreateOrderTool(),
    new TrackOrderTool(),
    new CancelOrderTool()
  ]
});
```

```typescript Bad: Unfocused
const everythingSkill = new LuaSkill({
  name: "all-features",
  description: "Does everything",
  tools: [
    new OrderTool(),
    new WeatherTool(),
    new EmailTool(),
    new RandomTool()
    // Unrelated tools mixed together
  ]
});
```

</CodeGroup>

### 2. Context is Your Guide

The context field is where you teach the AI how to be effective:

```typescript
// ✅ Good context teaches the agent
context: `
  Tool Usage:
  - search_orders: When user says "where is my order",
    "track my package", or "order status". 
    Ask for order number if not provided.
  
  When NOT to use:
  - Don't search_orders for product questions
  - Don't search_orders without order number
`

// ❌ Bad context doesn't teach
context: "Use the tools when needed"
```

### 3. Include Tool Descriptions

Explain **when** and **how** to use each tool:

```typescript
context: `
  - search_products: Use when users describe what they want to buy
    (e.g., "looking for laptop", "need running shoes").
    Returns: List of matching products.
    
  - get_product_details: Use when user wants more info about
    a specific product (e.g., "tell me more about item #123").
    Returns: Full specs, reviews, availability.
`
```

## Multi-Skill Projects

You can have multiple skills in one project:

```typescript
// Skill 1: Product browsing
const catalogSkill = new LuaSkill({
  name: "product-catalog",
  description: "Product search and details",
  tools: [new SearchTool(), new DetailsTool()]
});

// Skill 2: Shopping cart
const cartSkill = new LuaSkill({
  name: "shopping-cart",
  description: "Cart and checkout",
  tools: [new AddToCartTool(), new CheckoutTool()]
});

// Skill 3: Orders
const orderSkill = new LuaSkill({
  name: "order-tracking",
  description: "Order status and tracking",
  tools: [new TrackOrderTool()]
});
```

**Benefits:**
- Logical separation
- Independent versioning
- Clear ownership
- Easier maintenance
