## How to Configure

```typescript
persona: `
  After showing options to users, ALWAYS provide relevant actions:
  
  ::: actions
  - [Primary action]
  - [Secondary action]
  - [Alternative action]
  :::
  
  Examples:
  - After products: "Add to Cart", "View Details"
  - After rooms: "Book Now", "See Photos"
  - After articles: "Read More", "Share"
`
```

## Best Practices

- Use verbs: "Book", "View", "Check"
- Be specific: "Add to Cart" not "Continue"
- Limit to 5-7 for best UX
- Order by importance
