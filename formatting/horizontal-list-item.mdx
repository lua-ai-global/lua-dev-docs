## Overview

The **Horizontal-List-Item** component displays items as a horizontally scrollable **Media Card Carousel**. This is ideal for showcasing multiple options in a compact, swipeable format.

<Card title="Perfect for:" icon="images">
  Product categories, menu sections, room options, service packages - any list where visual browsing is key
</Card>

<Warning>
**WhatsApp Only**: This component currently only works on WhatsApp Business. On other channels, it falls back to the standard list-item format.
</Warning>

## Format

```
::: horizontal-list-item
![image](Image-URL)
#Item Title
##Item Subheading
Brief description of the item.
:::
```

</CardGroup>

### Meta/WhatsApp Restrictions

<Warning>
These are restrictions imposed by Meta's WhatsApp Business API:
</Warning>

| Restriction | Limit |
|-------------|-------|
| Cards per carousel | 2-10 |
| Card body text | 160 characters max |
| Header text | 60 characters max |
| Image format | JPEG, PNG |
| Buttons per card | Up to 2 (quick reply, URL, or phone) |

<Note>
**Template Approval**: Carousel templates require Meta approval. The system creates templates automatically when you first use this component. The first request falls back to list-item format while templates are pending approval (~30 seconds to a few minutes).
</Note>

### Current Implementation Defaults

<Info>
These are current implementation choices that may become configurable in the future:
</Info>

| Setting | Current Value |
|---------|---------------|
| Button per card | 1 quick reply with text "Select" |
| Button payload | `#Header` (sent to agent when user taps) |
| Template body text | `Results: {remainderText}. Browse below.` |
| Card body format | `Details: {header + subHeading + body}. Select below.` |
| Default image | Lua placeholder when no image provided |

**Parameter mapping from component:**
```
::: horizontal-list-item
![image](image-url)        → Card header image
#Item Title                → Button payload + part of card body
##Subheading               → Part of card body
Description text here.     → Part of card body
:::
```

The card body combines all text (`#Title - ##Subheading - Description`) into a single parameter, truncated to 135 characters to fit WhatsApp's 160 char limit with the static text.

When user taps "Select", the agent receives: `Select: *Item Title*`

## How It Works

### First-Time Use

1. Agent responds with `horizontal-list-item` components
2. System checks if carousel templates exist
3. If templates don't exist:
   - Creates templates in background (async)
   - Falls back to list-item format for this request
4. Templates submitted to Meta for approval (~30 sec to minutes)
5. Next request uses the approved carousel templates

### User Interaction

When a user taps "Select" on a carousel card:
- The agent receives: `Select: *Item Title*`
- Example: `Select: *Caramel Latte*`

This allows the agent to know exactly which item the user selected.

## How to Configure

### In Persona

```yaml
persona: |
  When showing product categories or menu sections, use horizontal-list-item for a carousel view:
  
  ::: horizontal-list-item
  ![image](category-image-url)
  #Category Name
  ##Item Count or Key Info
  Brief description of the category.
  :::
  
  Requirements:
  - Minimum 2 items, maximum 10 items per carousel
  - Always include an image for each item
  - Keep descriptions under 160 characters
```

### In Skill Context

```typescript
const menuSkill = new LuaSkill({
  context: `
    When showing menu categories, format as horizontal carousel:
    
    ::: horizontal-list-item
    ![image](category.imageUrl)
    #category.name
    ##category.itemCount items
    category.description
    :::
    
    This creates a swipeable carousel on WhatsApp.
    Minimum 2 categories required for carousel format.
  `
});
```

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="✅ Use for Visual Browsing">
    ```
    ✅ Good use cases:
    - Product categories
    - Menu sections  
    - Room types
    - Service tiers
    
    ❌ Not ideal for:
    - Single items
    - Text-heavy content
    - Sequential steps
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="✅ Keep Text Concise">
    ```
    ✅ Good:
    Rich espresso with steamed milk. Available hot or iced.
    
    ❌ Bad:
    Our signature caramel latte is made with premium espresso beans 
    sourced from Colombia, combined with locally sourced organic milk 
    that is perfectly steamed to 160°F... (too long - will be truncated)
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="✅ Use High-Quality Images">
    - Square or landscape orientation works best
    - Images are automatically cropped to wide ratio
    - Use HTTPS URLs
    - Ensure images load quickly
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="✅ Provide Meaningful Subheadings">
    ```
    ✅ Good:
    ##$4.50 - Popular
    ##12 Options Available
    ##$200/night - 2 Available
    
    ❌ Bad:

## Comparison: List-Item vs Horizontal-List-Item

| Feature | List-Item | Horizontal-List-Item |
|---------|-----------|---------------------|
| Layout | Vertical (stacked) | Horizontal (carousel) |
| Channels | All channels | WhatsApp only |
| Min items | 1 | 2 |
| Max items | 10 | 10 (per carousel) |
| Image | Optional | Required |
| Interaction | View only | "Select" button |
| Best for | Detailed listings | Visual browsing |

## Fallback Behavior

When horizontal-list-item can't render as a carousel:

| Situation | Behavior |
|-----------|----------|
| Non-WhatsApp channel | Falls back to list-item |
| Less than 2 items | Falls back to list-item |
| Templates pending approval | Falls back to list-item |
| More than 10 items | Splits into multiple carousels |

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Carousel not showing on first use">
    This is expected! The first request creates templates which need Meta approval. 
    The response falls back to list-item format. Try again in 30 seconds to a few minutes.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Getting list-item format instead of carousel">
    Check:
    1. Are you on WhatsApp? (carousel is WhatsApp-only)
    2. Do you have at least 2 items?
    3. Have templates been approved? (check agent logs)
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Images not displaying">
    Ensure images are:
    - Using HTTPS URLs
    - Publicly accessible
    - In JPEG or PNG format
    - Loading within reasonable time
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Text being truncated">
    WhatsApp limits card body to 160 characters. Keep descriptions concise.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
