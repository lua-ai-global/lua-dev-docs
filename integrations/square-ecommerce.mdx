## Prerequisites

Before connecting Square to Lua:

1. **Active Square Account** - Sign up at [squareup.com](https://squareup.com)

<Warning>
**Important: Email Linking**

When you connect Square to Lua, your admin account will be automatically linked to an email address from your Square business. The system searches for an email in this priority order:

1. **Owner Email** - The merchant owner's email address
2. **Business Email** - Your main location's business email
3. **Team Member Email** - The first team member with owner role

Make sure at least one of these emails is valid and accessible, as you'll use it to access your Lua admin dashboard.

</Warning>

## Integration Setup

    **[https://auth.heylua.ai/square/auth](https://auth.heylua.ai/square/auth)**

      This secure OAuth flow connects your Square account to Lua without sharing
      your password.
    </Note>
  </Step>

<Step title="Sign In to Square">
  Click **"Sign in with Square"** or **"Continue with Square"** Enter your

    to connect in the next step.

    different Square locations. Just repeat this process for each agent/business
    combination.
  </Note>
</Step>

<Step title="Grant Permissions">
  Square will display the permissions that Lua needs to function. 
  
  **Lua requires access to:** 
    * 📦 Products & Inventory (for product search and availability),

    * 👤 Customer Info (for personalized service),
    * 💳 Payments (for checkout links)

  with "Allow" button*
  <Warning>
    **About Permissions**: Lua only requests the minimum permissions needed to
    help your customers. Your payment details and sensitive business data remain
    secure with Square.
