## Prerequisites

Before connecting Square to Lua:

1. **Active Square Account** - Sign up at [squareup.com](https://squareup.com)

<Note>
  Square Appointments is included with Square Plus ($29/month) or higher plans.
  The free plan has limited appointment features.
</Note>

<Warning>
**Important: Email Linking**

When you connect Square to Lua, your admin account will be automatically linked to an email address from your Square business. The system searches for an email in this priority order:

1. **Owner Email** - The merchant owner's email address
2. **Business Email** - Your main location's business email
3. **Team Member Email** - The first team member with owner role

Make sure at least one of these emails is valid and accessible, as you'll use it to access your Lua admin dashboard.
